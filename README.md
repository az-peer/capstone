## About 
In protein X-ray crystallography, protein crystals are exposed to bright sources of X-rays, and
the resulting diffraction patterns are recorded on two-dimensional images. By processing the
images, researchers can obtain atomic-scale information about the proteinâ€™s structure. This is
invaluable for our understanding of how proteins operate in, for example, therapeutics or
energy production. Recently we are using artificial intelligence to build computational models
that can automatically process protein diffraction images. The goal of this project will be to
train new AI models to recognize the geometry of the of the images. An example of one of the images looks like.

## Key Objectives

- **Group 1**:
  - Train deep learning models on crystal diffraction images as a supervised learning problem.
  - Predict the exact center of the image.
  - Detect misalignment.
